first page is a signup page.
Signup page contains name, mobile, email, password and confirm password.
In which you can store your data and create your password.
password contains few condition- must contain lowercase, uppercase, numbers and should be 10 character long.
for satisfying the condition given condition- I used javascript for functionality checking purpose and CSS for if condition will right then condition will turn into green color.
if somehow password is not matching with condition then it will give error.
